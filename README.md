This is a simple e-commerce website with four pages; Products, Product Details, Checkout and Success Pages.
I also made use of react components. I have a Navbar, Footer, Product and the main App component.
I used react-router-dom to navigate between my pages and my routers are in my App component.
In my design, i put myself in the shoes of someone looking to buy something on the internet. I would want something simple yet appeasing. 
I added a few animations here and there to add a vibe to the website.
I kept the colors well mixed and matched and all my pages have a sense of familiarity to them. Yet they are all unique.
I feel i could have made more since i had to do this website whilst writing and studying for two papers today.
It was a very fun thing to build and i will use the knowledge and some insight i gained whilst working on this to develop better stuff.
I will keep working on this, though. But for now, i am submitting this due to the deadline.
Typing 'npm run dev' in your terminal in the project's directory would do the trick if you want to start the website
